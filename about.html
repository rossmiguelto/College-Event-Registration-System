            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The College Event Registration System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to streamline 
                the process of event management and registration for college students, faculty, and administrators. 
                Our system aims to centralize event information, simplify registration procedures, and enhance 
                campus engagement through technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This platform was developed as part of a software engineering project to address the challenges 
                faced by students in discovering and registering for campus events. Whether it's academic seminars, 
                cultural festivals, sports tournaments, or club activities, our system provides a one-stop solution 
                for all event-related needs.
